# Newfangled
Full Stack Django, Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS project for personal **coffee** site.

I created this site for myself, because I truly enjoy **coffee**. 
I was familiar with Python and used that as a jumping off point to explore Full Stack development.
I had spent some time learning Django and used this as a capstone for myself. 

* The site allows for user sign-in and allows users to comment on each post.
  I adjusted the default Django user creation to use a users Email instead of a username for sign-in.

* As a site Admin I can sign in and create a post on the site, with a built-in text-editor, and upload photos.

* This site is currently hosted on a personal centOS server, using APACHE, all setup by yours truly.

I would love to discuss more on how I created the site or even just discuss **coffee**, if you're interested!
